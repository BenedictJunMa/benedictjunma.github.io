Hi! My name is Benedict Jun Ma (馬軍). I am currently a PhD Candidate in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/y-h-kuo) and [Prof. George Q. Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/george-huang/). Before this, I received my BEng degree in Automation from Northeast Forestry University (part of Project 211 & Double First-Class Construction), Harbin, China.

During my PhD study, I had several academic visits and activities outside of Hong Kong. I was a Visiting Doctoral Student at [Mines Paris, PSL University](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu) from August to December 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Shenle Pan](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/Services/Annuaire/shenle-pan). I spent one week taking the Course BEA522 on Rural Logistics at [Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/) (NHH) in July 2023.
