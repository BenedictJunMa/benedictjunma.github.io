Hi! My name is Benedict Jun Ma (馬軍). I am currently a PhD Candidate in Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk), supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/y-h-kuo) and [Prof. George Q. Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/george-huang/). Before this, I received my BEng degree in Automation from Northeast Forestry University (part of Project 211 & Double First-Class Construction), Harbin, China.

During my PhD study, I had several academic visits outside of Hong Kong. I was a Visiting Doctoral Student at [Mines Paris, PSL University](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu), France, from August to December 2023. I spent one week taking the Course BEA 552 Rural Logistics at NHH.
