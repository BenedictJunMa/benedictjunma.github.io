Hi! My name is Benedict Jun Ma (馬軍). I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL)](https://ctl.mit.edu/about/bio/benedict-jun-ma), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to this, I earned my PhD in Industrial Engineering from The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/y-h-kuo) and [Prof. George Q. Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/george-huang/). My research interests include logistics and supply chain management, warehouse operations and management, and computational intelligence with applications.

During my PhD study, I had several academic visits and activities outside of Hong Kong. I was a Visiting Doctoral Student at Mines Paris, PSL University from August to November 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Shenle Pan](https://cv.hal.science/shenle-pan). I attended the course [BEA522 on Rural Logistics](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/rural-logistics/) at Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in July 2023. I also visited Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), Erasmus University, and discussed my research with [Prof. Rene de Koster](https://www.rsm.nl/people/rene-de-koster/).
