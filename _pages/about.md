Hi! My name is Benedict Jun Ma (馬軍). I am currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Thrust of Intelligent Transportation](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/MA-BenedictJun/junm), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). My research explores how emerging technologies enhance operational efficiency and decision-making, with a focus on systems in transportation, logistics, and supply chains. Specifically, my research directions include Smart warehousing and logistics, AI-driven human-robot collaboration, and Human-AI collective intelligence.

**I am actively seeking self-motivated and hardworking PhD/MPhil students to work on various research topics in my group.** Candidates with a strong background in Computer Science, Transportation Engineering, Automation, Industrial Engineering, or Applied Mathematics are encouraged to apply, expected to enroll in Spring/Fall 2026. Regular full-time PhD/MPhil students are normally considered eligible to receive a Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS) that is sufficient to cover tuition fees and living expenses in Guangzhou. I also welcome research assistants and visiting students to work together and provide adequate financial support.

Prior to joining HKUST(GZ), I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Center for Transportation & Logistics (CTL)](https://ctl.mit.edu/), Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I was also affiliated with the [MIT Supply Chain Management](https://scm.mit.edu/people/benedict-jun-ma/) and the [MIT Digital Supply Chain Lab](https://digitalsc.mit.edu). I earned my PhD in the Department of Data and Systems Engineering from The University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Yong-Hong Kuo](https://www.dase.hku.hk/people/y-h-kuo) and [Prof. George Q. Huang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ise/people/academic-staff/george-huang/). 

During my PhD study, I made several academic visits and activities outside of Hong Kong. I was a Visiting Doctoral Student at Mines Paris, PSL University from August to November 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Shenle Pan](https://cv.hal.science/shenle-pan). I attended the course [BEA522 on Rural Logistics](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/rural-logistics/) at Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in July 2023. I also visited the Rotterdam School of Management (RSM), Erasmus University, and discussed my research with [Prof. Rene de Koster](https://www.rsm.nl/people/rene-de-koster/). These experiences have brought me an international academic vision.
